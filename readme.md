Project Description
===================

Search Boost .NET aims to be the .NET Search Engine, similar to how SOLR is for Java platform. 
It will be able to power up search for Asp.NET websites but also provide a scalable distributed search platform for the enterprise.
See the UML diagrams under the doc folder for more info.
This system is based on the experience I gained while developing the [DotNetNuke Search Boost module](http://www.dnnsharp.com/dotnetnuke/modules/dnn-search/SearchBoost.aspx).

Status
======

The Search Boost .NET project is currently under development.
